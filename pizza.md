# Instructions

Dissolve yeast in milk and set aside for 10 minutes or until mixture bubbles. Stir in 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of oil. Place flour in a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Pour in yeast mixture and mix until a firm dough; add a little warm water if mixture is too dry. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 5 minutes or until smooth and elastic. (Alternatively, use an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook.) Place dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and leave in a warm, draught-free place for 1 hour or until dough doubles in size. Punch down dough and turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Using a rolling pin lightly dusted with flour, roll dough to fit a greased 38 cm x 26 cm oven tray. Prick dough with a fork and brush with remaining 1 tablespoon of oil.Preheat oven to 250ºC. Spread passata over pizza base and top with anchovies and olives. Bake for 15 minutes or until base is golden. Scatter with parmesan and oregano to serve.

**Note**

•White anchovies in oil are available from delis and specialist food shops. Substitute regular anchovy fillets.
